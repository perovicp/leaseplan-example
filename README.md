# Getting started with Serenity and Cucumber and Gitlab

Serenity BDD is a library that makes it easier to write high quality automated acceptance tests, with powerful reporting and living documentation features. It has strong support for both web testing with Selenium, and API testing using RestAssured.

Serenity strongly encourages good test automation design, and supports several design patterns, including classic Page Objects, the newer Lean Page Objects/ Action Classes approach, and the more sophisticated and flexible Screenplay pattern.

The latest version of Serenity supports Cucumber 5.5.

## The leasing demo project
The best place to start with Serenity and Cucumber is to clone or download the starter project on Github ([https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter)). This project gives you a basic project setup, along with some sample tests and supporting classes. There are two versions to choose from. The master branch uses a more classic approach, using action classes and lightweight page objects, whereas the **[screenplay](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter/tree/screenplay)** branch shows the same sample test implemented using Screenplay.

### The project directory structure
The project has build scripts for both Maven and Gradle, and follows the standard directory structure used in most Serenity projects:
```Gherkin
src
  + main
  + test
    + java                        Test runners and configuration code
    + resources
      + features                    Feature files
     + search                  Feature file subdirectories 
             products.feature
```

```Gherkin
Feature: Search by keyword

  Scenario: Searching for a term
    Given Sergey is researching things on the internet
    When he looks up "Cucumber"
    Then he should see information about "Cucumber"
```

### The Screenplay implementation
The sample code in the master branch uses the Screenplay pattern. The Screenplay pattern describes tests in terms of actors and the tasks they perform. Tasks are represented as objects performed by an actor, rather than methods. This makes them more flexible and composable, at the cost of being a bit more wordy. Here is an example:
```java
    @Given("{actor} is researching things on the internet")
    public void researchingThings(Actor actor) {
        actor.wasAbleTo(NavigateTo.theWikipediaHomePage());
    }

    @When("{actor} looks up {string}")
    public void searchesFor(Actor actor, String term) {
        actor.attemptsTo(
                LookForInformation.about(term)
        );
    }

    @Then("{actor} should see information about {string}")
    public void should_see_information_about(Actor actor, String term) {
        actor.attemptsTo(
                Ensure.that(WikipediaArticle.HEADING).hasText(term)
        );
    }
```


The Screenplay DSL is rich and flexible, and well suited to teams working on large test automation projects with many team members, and who are reasonably comfortable with Java and design patterns. 

### The Action Classes implementation.

A more imperative-style implementation using the Action Classes pattern can be found in the `action-classes` branch. The glue code in this version looks this this:

```java
    @Given("^(?:.*) is researching things on the internet")
    public void i_am_on_the_Wikipedia_home_page() {
        navigateTo.theHomePage();
    }

    @When("she/he looks up {string}")
    public void i_search_for(String term) {
        searchFor.term(term);
    }

    @Then("she/he should see information about {string}")
    public void all_the_result_titles_should_contain_the_word(String term) {
        assertThat(searchResult.displayed()).contains(term);
    }
```

## Executing the tests
To run the sample project, you can either just run the `CucumberTestSuite` test runner class, or run either `mvn verify` or `gradle test` from the command line.

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Ddriver=firefox
```
The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity/index.html`.

## Generating the reports
Since the Serenity reports contain aggregate information about all of the tests, they are not generated after each individual test (as this would be extremenly inefficient). Rather, The Full Serenity reports are generated by the `serenity-maven-plugin`. You can trigger this by running `mvn serenity:aggregate` from the command line or from your IDE.

They reports are also integrated into the Maven build process: the following code in the `pom.xml` file causes the reports to be generated automatically once all the tests have completed when you run `mvn verify`?

```
             <plugin>
                <groupId>net.serenity-bdd.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${serenity.maven.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <tags>${tags}</tags>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>serenity-reports</id>
                        <phase>post-integration-test</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>aggregate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

You use the `environment` system property to determine which environment to run against. For example to run the tests in the staging environment, you could run:
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Denvironment=staging
```
